# 4 Evaluation

We have learnt:

- To use the function language F# by implementing a methodology to automatically structure trees such that they obey certain aesthetic rules.
- With f# how to represent a nested data structure visually with SVG.
- How to use property based testing to ensure the validity of the implementation.
- Generating arbitrary test data of a nested data structure in a safe way to avoid stack overflow because of infinite recursion.
