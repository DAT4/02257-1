title: Project 1 - Functional Pearls - Drawing Trees

abstract: 'In this report, we implement a method in `F#` that is able to automatically structure trees such that they obey certain aesthical rules. It is validated that the rules are obeyed by using property based testing where FsCheck is used to generate randomly generated input using our own implementation of a random tree generator. Finally, we present a methodology for visualizing the trees by converting to SVG format.'
